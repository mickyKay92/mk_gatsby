Excerpt: S.T.E.A.M is a daycare centre that focuses on science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics.\n The client wanted something modern and original that conveyed their core values. The client loved my initial drawings and how it immediately conveyed what they were about, It only took a few colour changes before we landed on pastel blue and grey.
